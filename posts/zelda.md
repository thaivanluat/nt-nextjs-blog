[The Legend of Zelda](https://www.dualshockers.com/tag/zelda/) series has released over 20 games in its 35-year history. Many of its titles have propelled adventure games towards the quality they are now. The original game, Ocarina of Time, and Breath of the Wild specifically have greatly impacted the gaming industry as a whole.

With a such an important series comes many iconic moments that have stood the test of time. This list will highlight the most impactful moments from the entire series in order from oldest to newest.

10 The Master Sword (A Link To The Past)
----------------------------------------

A Link to the Past massively impacted the direction that the entire Zelda series took, and one key aspect of that is the introduction of the Master Sword. After obtaining three pendents, Link is able to retrieve it from the Lost Woods.

The Master Sword quickly became a very iconic weapon that would be in nearly half the mainline games that followed. Lost Woods and the Master Sword's pedestal also became reoccurring locations in the series.

9 7 Year Time Skip (Ocarina Of Time)
------------------------------------

    

The second appearance of the Master Sword holds an even greater purpose. The hero of time isn't considered old enough upon picking it up for the first time. Due to this, the sword transports Link 7 years into the future.

Placing the Master Sword back in its pedestals allows Link to travel back to the original era he came from. This mechanic is required at least once in the story, but it can be activated whenever the player wants to.

8 Ganondorf Final Fight (Ocarina Of Time)
-----------------------------------------

    

Ganon was a villain ever since the original The Legend of Zelda on NES, but he didn't have much of a backstory or personality then. He gained slightly more depth in A Link to the Past, but still not enough to make him a real stand-out villain. He became much more compelling when his human form named Ganondorf was introduced in Ocarina of Time.

He obtained a personality and interesting backstory. Ganondorf took over Hyrule during the time skip and eventually acted as the game's final boss, during which Link had to fight both his human and beast forms. Both phases were really memorable fights and would go onto inspire many other fights with the demon king in other installments.

7 The Moon (Majora's Mask)
--------------------------

    

The moon is constantly falling towards Termina throughout Majora's Mask. If Link doesn't stop it within 3 days, then all of Termina gets completely destroyed. Its menacing face became one of the most recognizable parts of the game.

Upon actually reaching the moon, players discover the surface is actually really peaceful. It's a grassy field with a tree in the center. The out-of-place atmosphere makes it the most memorable location in the entire game.

6 Zelda Team Up (Wind Waker)
----------------------------

    

Tetra was a very unique pirate themed incarnation of Zelda. Unlike most of the damsel's in distress Zeldas that came before her, Tetra was a warrior who was willing to fight off threats herself.

Her being one of the first Zeldas to aid Link in a boss fight made sense. The aquatic tower, Ganondorf's attacks, and the reliance on Zelda make this fight with Ganondorf stick out from previous Ganondorf fights.

5 Wolf Transformation (Twilight Princess)
-----------------------------------------

    

The initial wolf transformation occurs when the forest near Link's hometown gets overthrown by Twilight. People inside got turned into ghosts, but the Triforce of Courage allowed Link to keep a physical form.

From that point on, Link took the form of a wolf every time he got exposed to the Twilight. As a wolf, Link has entirely different attacks and abilities, such as being able to smell scents.

4 Final Goodbye (Twilight Princess)
-----------------------------------

    

Midna originally only wanted to use Link to help her reclaim her throne, but eventually Midna started to genuinely like Link. During the final boss fight, there's slight implication that Ganondorf killed Midna, but she is revealed to still be alive in the end.

The reunion is short-lived, however, since Midna was preparing to depart back to her world. As she left, Midna destroyed the rift between their realms, since it was the only way to keep Hyrule safe. It's a great, emotional send off to one of the best traveling companions Link has ever had.

3 Creating The Master Sword (Skyward Sword)
-------------------------------------------

    

The origin of the Master Sword was never revealed until Skyward Sword was released. It's a game at the start of the Zelda timeline, and it explains the origin story of a lot of major plotlines that span the entire series.

Link received a sword blessed by the goddess near the start of the game. After a few upgrades, it eventually evolves into the Master Sword. Forging one of the most recognizable weapons in video games history was a very exciting moment.

2 The Finale (Skyward Sword)
----------------------------

    

The Imprisoned is a massive monster sealed away in a large pit. It attempts to break out a few times, but Link always stopped it. Near the end, Link fought through a massive horde of monsters to reach Ghirahim. After their fight, Ghirahim revealed that the Imprisoned was actually his master, Demise.

Demise transports Link to a different dimension to fight. After being defeated, Demise curses Link. His anger would reincarnate as Ganon for many generations to come. The ending sequence showed the origin of Hyrule, revealed who the old woman who helped Link who, and what happened to Fi.

1 The Beginning (Breath Of The Wild)
------------------------------------

    

Link wakes up in a regenerative pool within a highly advanced Sheikah lab. Little about what happened to Link is revealed at the beginning, so this introduction is very mysterious.

The very important Sheikah Slate is received almost immediately. Link's first few steps outside showcase the vast world of Hyrule. The Shrine of Resurrection is nearly in the center of the whole map, so taking a view around lets players see many spectacular locations.
